From relationships to the rapport that they share with each other, Katrina and Ali redefined womance and we totally loved it.During one of the show's segments, the host Neha Dhupia asked Katrina about that one actress with whom she would be unwilling to appear on the show. While sources revealed that initially Katrina was hesitant to give out any names, but she soon was prompted by Alia. The 'Raazi' actress reportedly suggested Kriti Sanon's name to Katrina, and she too accepted. However, what led to a weird situation is when Katrina mispronounced Kriti's name by calling her Kirti.It was then Alia who corrected her and told her that the 'Raabta' actress' name was Kriti.Meanwhile, Katrina was also asked about which celebrity's style choice makes her go WTF. The source further said, \"It was for a segment called Scary Spice. First, she named Ranveer Singh, but later tried to balance it by adding that she meant it in a good way.\"Revealing how the two became friends the source informed, \"They revealed that they grew fond of each other while spending time together at the Bandra gym. Alia said that Katrina usually needs a partner to work out with, and finds one in her.\"",

International sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter’s revenue. \nApple once before surpassed Samsung in handset shipments – in the fourth quarter of 2016. But that was considered an anomaly by analysts at the time. \n\"Apple had a good holiday quarter [in 2016], but it was also the same time Samsung was going through that whole issue with the Note 7 and the battery issue. So Samsung was having its own issues, while Apple was doing well,\" Reith said. \"There was no anomaly this quarter. There's no question [Apple is] gaining traction.\" \nApple shipments, Reith said, are driven by holiday sales because their new product release cycle comes just prior to that season",
